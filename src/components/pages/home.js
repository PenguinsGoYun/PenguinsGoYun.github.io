          Hello, I'm a curious computer science student at the University of Notre Dame. I enjoy learning from and hearing stories of people who are more experienced than I am in this field. When possible, I prefer to work together on projects in a group and see how other people approach various problems. During my free time I either play videogames, practice the piano, sing, or work on some projects that I have in mind.
